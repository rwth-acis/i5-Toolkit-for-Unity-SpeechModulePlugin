# i5-Toolkit-for-Unity-SpeechModulePlugin
This repository contains the third-party plugins for the `NativeSpeechRecognizer` and `NativeSpeechSynthesizer` of the Speech Module in the [i5-Toolki-for-Unity](https://github.com/rwth-acis/i5-Toolkit-for-Unity).

You can directly download this folder or download the packages in Release and import them to your project, but it is strongly recommended to use the built-in importer of the speech module to import the native recognizer and synthesizer. For more detailed infomation, please read the wiki page of the Speech Module.
